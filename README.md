## The Problem
I was working on the backend of a web project of mine and I forgot what the HTTP status code `418` was, so instead of opening a web browser I of course used this as an excuse to write my very first golang project.

turns out I was getting trolled...

anyways now I can get these hypertext transfer protocol kitties right from a terminal ⛱️ ☺️
